summary:    Nag Tibba ('Serpent's Peak'), 3,022 metres (9,915 ft) is an ideal weekend trek suited for most people looking for a refresher from the boring routine. This trek can be done throughout the winter season when most of the treks in higher Himalayan ranges are closed.The trek can be done in 3 days from Delhi which makes it an ideal trek for weekends.Given its moderate level of challenge, anyone with a normal fitness can do this trek. The trek offers some of the best camping locations.The route goes through thick deodar forest. With only a day into the trek one reaches to very remote region with almost no habitation. A great refresher and trailer for new trekkers who are yet to see the full movie of a long trek.
